## Title: Agile Estimation Metrics

### Objective:
To understand and apply Agile estimation techniques and metrics such as story points, velocity, and planning poker. The goal is to evaluate how estimation improves predictability and planning in Agile projects.

### Tools Used:
- **Trello / Jira / Excel** – for task tracking and sprint planning
- **Planning Poker app / cards** – for collaborative estimation
- **Whiteboard or Notepad** – for notetaking and backlog grooming
- **Agile Board or Spreadsheet** – to calculate team velocity and track metrics

### Methodology:
The lab was divided into the following activities:

#### Step 1: Understanding Story Points
- Discussed story points as a unitless measure of effort and complexity
- Compared with tasks by relative sizing (e.g., a task twice as hard as another = double the points)

#### Step 2: Estimation with Planning Poker
- Formed teams of 4–6 members
- Each team was given a product backlog with several user stories
- Used Planning Poker to estimate each story collaboratively
- Discussed differing estimates and reached consensus

#### Step 3: Calculating Team Velocity
- Used estimated story points from 2 hypothetical sprints:
  - Sprint 1 completed: 20 story points
  - Sprint 2 completed: 23 story points
- Calculated average team velocity:
  - **Velocity = (20 + 23) / 2 = 21.5 story points per sprint**

#### Step 4: Forecasting Future Work
- Given a backlog of 64 points and a velocity of 21.5:
  - **Estimated time to complete: ~3 sprints**

### Results:
- Developed accurate relative estimates for user stories
- Practiced team collaboration and consensus-building through Planning Poker
- Calculated team velocity and learned how to use it to forecast sprint capacity
- Realized the benefit of abstract estimation over time-based estimation for Agile flexibility

### Conclusion:
Agile estimation metrics provide a lightweight yet effective way to plan and manage tasks in a sprint. Story points and velocity help teams forecast work realistically and accommodate change. The lab reinforced the value of team collaboration in estimation and highlighted how consistent tracking improves project predictability.
