 Lab 3: Deployment Tools in Agile
 OBJECTIVES:
->To understand and use deployment tools that help automate the process of delivering software in Agile development.

INTRODUCTION:
In Agile, code is released frequently. Deployment tools help automate the process of building, testing, and launching software, ensuring faster and more reliable delivery.

TOOLS USED:
GitHub – code hosting
Netlify – deploy frontend websites
Heroku – deploy backend apps
GitHub Actions – CI/CD automation

STEPS:
1. Netlify (Frontend Deployment)
Created simple HTML website
Pushed code to GitHub
Connected repo to Netlify
Netlify auto-deploys the site on each commit

2. Heroku (Backend Deployment)
Created Node.js Express API
Added Procfile for Heroku config
Pushed code using Heroku CLI
Live backend hosted on Heroku

3. GitHub Actions (Automation)
Created .yml workflow file

Automated tasks on git push (like testing or build)

RESULT:
Successfully deployed frontend and backend apps with automation. Understood how deployment tools support Agile principles of fast, continuous delivery.

CONCLUSION:
Deployment tools like Netlify, Heroku, and GitHub Actions help teams deliver updates quickly and safely, supporting Agile practices.
