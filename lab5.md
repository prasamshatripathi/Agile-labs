# Lab 5: Use of Kanban Board

## Objective
To understand the use of the Kanban Board in Agile project management for visualizing work, limiting work-in-progress (WIP), and maximizing flow efficiency. The objective is to learn how Kanban supports transparency, adaptability, and continuous delivery.

## Tools Used
- **Trello / Jira** – for Kanban board implementation
- **Sticky Notes or Cards** – to represent tasks (for physical boards)
- **Markers and Labels** – for categorizing tasks and swim lanes
- **Web browser and internet** – to access online Kanban tools

## Methodology
The lab was carried out in the following stages:

### Step 1: Introduction to Kanban
Learned about Kanban principles:
- Visualize the workflow
- Limit WIP
- Manage flow
- Make process policies explicit
- Improve collaboratively

### Step 2: Kanban Board Setup
- Created columns for workflow stages:
  - To Do
  - In Progress
  - Testing
  - Done
- Added sample user stories as task cards
- Assigned team members and deadlines

### Step 3: WIP Limit Application
- Applied WIP limit of 2 on the In Progress column
- Ensured that no more than 2 tasks were being worked on simultaneously
- Monitored flow to avoid bottlenecks

### Step 4: Task Movement Simulation
Simulated a development sprint:
- Tasks moved from "To Do" → "In Progress" → "Testing" → "Done"
- Logged issues such as bottlenecks or idle stages
- Discussed improvements for balancing workload

## Sample Task Card

**Title:** Implement Login API  
**Assignee:** John  
**Due Date:** June 24  
**Priority:** High  

**Description:**
- Create a secure API endpoint to authenticate users
- Validate email and password inputs
- Generate and return a session token on successful login
- Handle error responses for invalid credentials or missing data

## Results
- Successfully visualized the flow of tasks using the Kanban board
- Observed how limiting WIP improves task focus and flow efficiency
- Understood the importance of continuously improving the process based on actual performance

## Conclusion
The Kanban Board is a powerful Agile tool that enhances transparency, limits overload, and streamlines task execution. This lab provided hands-on experience with managing flow and revealed how even small changes in WIP limits or task distribution can significantly affect project efficiency.
